# Formatron

"Formatting code is a mostly mechanical task which takes both time and mental effort.
By using an automatic formatting tool, a programmer is relieved of this task and can concentrate on more important things.
Furthermore, by sticking to an established style guide (such as this one),
programmers don't need to formulate ad hoc style rules,
nor do they need to debate with other programmers what style rules should be used, saving time, communication overhead, and mental energy."

Just throw these scripts into your code and run format_code.bat to make any messy C++ source human readable.
